# jMap

This is a project which provides an interactive map of Jacobs University Bremen. It is an upgrade of the pre-existing jPeople by Stefan Mirea, as it provides a visulaiztion of room data. i.e. it has maps.

See the demo at http://tkw1536.github.io/jMap/ (external mode only)

## How it works

* Has three frames: 
	* `nav`: navigation
	* `renderer`: renders map
	* `bridge`: Serves as a bridge between other frames
	* some eastereggs (spoilers??? you have been warned)

## Data Structure

Sample data for buildings can be found in data/99_sample*.js.
